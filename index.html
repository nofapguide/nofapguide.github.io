		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>Hello and welcome. My alias is AJQ, I am a guy who quit nofap for about a year now, this has improved my life considerably. I'm not here to convince you about why you must start nofap, my only intention is to help those who are willing to quit, but don't have the tools necessary to do so. In my guides I will attempt to cover as many aspects of nofap as possible, including information for beginners and more advanced content aswell, potentially about the philosophy of nofap.</p>
